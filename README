EditLite is a text editor for JavaME platform, it consists of 4 components:

1.Text Editor

support Unicode/UTF-8/GB2312 and transcoding among them.

support common edit options,such as cut/copy/paste/delete/save/select/search/jump.

2.Text Reader

support open large-sized file.

support bookmark.

support paging.

3.File Manager

somewhat like Windows File Manager, support mv/rm/cp/rename/new/open/find.

4.Customize

support user customize the backgroup/theme/font.

Due to the RAM limited in JavaME device, these was no text reader/editor for JavaME could handle large-sized text file, most of them simply load the whole file into RAM when open it.

I implemented a light-weight memory management for EditLite, somewhat like the VM mechanism in the OS. So that EditLite can handle large-sized text file, independent of the platform's runtime RAM.
